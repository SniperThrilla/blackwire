# BlackWire

## About
BlackWire is a Layer 2 VPN which uses TAP interfaces to drop remote machines directly onto your LAN. No routing tables, no NAT, no unnecessary complexity - the client thinks it's plugged into the switch. DHCP, ARP, broadcasts, SMB, everything works as if it were native because the OS handles everything.

BlackWire wraps raw ethernet in a noise-based encryption tunnel, giving you a secure virtual cable between remote devices and your home/office network.
